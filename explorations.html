<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun with this activity. I found that, 
  after defining what a game is, it was easier to design 
  an interesting board game. I think that the game would 
  have been better if the board was bigger.</p>

<p>I thought the code for the coin game was much more fun 
  to do than the clicker game. However, both experiences 
  were beneficial in developing my skill in coding.</p>
